/**
 * What the Android back gesture does.
 *
 * Back is layered: a modal sits over the reader, the reader over the fullscreen player, and all
 * of them over ordinary navigation. Back should peel off the topmost layer rather than navigate,
 * and only fall through to history once nothing is covering the page.
 *
 * This lived inline in the backButton listener, which never ran: MainActivity registered its own
 * OnBackPressedCallback after Capacitor's AppPlugin had registered its own, and the dispatcher
 * runs them last-registered-first. So back went straight to webView.goBack() and could navigate
 * off the app's first history entry, reloading the whole app - which looks exactly like a crash
 * and restart.
