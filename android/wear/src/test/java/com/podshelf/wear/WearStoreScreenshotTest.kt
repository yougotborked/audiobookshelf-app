/**
 * Renders the watch screens to PNG, for the Play listing and for looking at them.
 *
 * Play will not take a Wear OS app without at least one screenshot of its interface, and there
 * was no way to produce one here: the web harness drives the Nuxt app in a browser and this
 * module is native Compose, and an emulator would be software-rendered without KVM. Robolectric
 * renders the real composables instead - the same code the watch runs, at the watch's own
 * screen size - which is what Play asks for: the app interface, 1:1, no device frame.
 *
 * `qualifiers` is a round 384x384 watch, the size Play wants and the shape a Galaxy Watch is.
