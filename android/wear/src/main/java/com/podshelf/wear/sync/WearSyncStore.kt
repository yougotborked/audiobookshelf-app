/**
 * What the phone last told this watch, kept across restarts.
 *
 * Persisted rather than held in memory because the whole point is a watch that works with the
 * phone absent: the Data Layer replays its items when a connection comes back, but nothing
 * replays them when the watch simply reboots on your wrist mid-run.
 *
 * The raw JSON is what is stored, not the parsed objects. A payload written by a newer phone
 * build then survives this app being older than it - it is decoded with ignoreUnknownKeys, and
 * re-decoded with whatever fields this build understands after an update.
