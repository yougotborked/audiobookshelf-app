     * The local network permission, when this device enforces it.
     *
     * Android 17 blocks an app from reaching a private address unless it holds
     * ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK. INTERNET is no longer enough. That matters more here than in most
     * apps: a self-hosted Audiobookshelf is usually on the same LAN as the phone, and split
     * horizon DNS means the very same hostname that works over mobile data resolves to a
     * 10.x/192.168.x address over Wi-Fi. Without the permission that connection does not fail
     * fast - the TCP connect simply times out - so it surfaces as "Failed to ping server" with
     * an address that looks perfectly reachable.
     *
     * Null below 37, where the permission does not exist and the platform grants local access
     * implicitly through INTERNET. Asking for it there is not just useless, it is what Google
     * explicitly tells apps not to do.
