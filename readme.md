## What it is

A fork of the [Audiobookshelf mobile app](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-app), reworked
around podcast listening rather than audiobooks, with **offline use and Android Auto treated as
primary cases rather than extras**.

Podshelf is a client. **It needs an [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org) server to
connect to** and provides no content of its own.

## What's different from upstream

**Podcast workflow**

- **Catch up** — one feed of unplayed episodes across your podcast libraries, oldest first, on the
  home screen.
- **Minimal mode** — the whole app reduced to one play control. No list to browse; it decides what
  is next by reading the library, and finishes a half-heard episode before starting anything new.
- **Per-podcast rules** — exclude a show from the queue, or keep only its newest *N* unplayed
  episodes, so one back catalogue cannot bury everything else.
- **Auto cache unplayed episodes** — downloads them in the background so they are ready without a
  connection.

**Offline, as a first-class state**

- **Disconnect / Continue Offline** — go offline deliberately and keep the normal app around you,
  rather than dropping to a bare file list.
- Reachability is judged by whether the server *answered*, not by whether the radio is up — so
  plane wifi, captive portals and patchy coverage behave sensibly instead of stalling on timeouts.
- Offline, the queue is built from what is actually on disk, so it never offers a stream it cannot
  play.

**In the car and on the lock screen**

- Android Auto browsing and playback with a working queue, skip/seek and playback speed.
- A proper media session, so lock screen, notification, watch and headset controls all work.

**Large screens and foldables**

- Content stops stretching past 600dp, where Android's medium window size class begins.
- **Tabletop posture** — with a foldable propped open and the hinge across the screen, the player
  lays the artwork out above the hinge instead of centring it across the fold.

**Listening stats worth opening**

- Streaks, an 18-badge ladder, and progress toward the next one.

Under the hood this fork has also moved Nuxt 2 → 3, Vuex → Pinia and ExoPlayer2 → Media3.

## Installing

Download the `podshelf-*.apk` from the [latest release](https://github.com/yougotborked/podshelf-app/releases/latest),
or from the [test page](https://yougotborked.github.io/podshelf-app/), which shows the build date
and commit. Every push to `master` publishes both.

- Android will ask you to allow installing from an unknown source the first time.
- These are **debug** builds, signed with the repo's debug key, package id `com.podshelf.app.debug`.
- Android only — iOS is not built or released here.
- It installs **alongside** upstream's Play Store app rather than replacing it.

> **Coming from a build made before the rename?** The application id changed from
> `com.audiobookshelf.app` to `com.podshelf.app`. Android treats that as a different app, so this
> installs alongside the old one rather than upgrading it, and app-private storage does not carry
> over — downloads have to come down again. Listening progress lives on your server, so it survives.
