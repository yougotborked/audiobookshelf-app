    Stats were reachable only from the side drawer, which is the definition of buried for the one
    number a listener is actually keeping. This puts the streak where they already look - above
    the queue they are about to play from - and makes it the way in.

    It renders nothing until there is a streak to show: a chip reading "0 days" on a new install
    is a scolding, not an invitation.
